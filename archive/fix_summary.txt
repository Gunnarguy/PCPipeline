# Virtual Environment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
- The original virtual environment (venv) had a corrupted pip installation
- The requirements.txt contained a package (textract 1.6.5) with invalid metadata format
- This caused both pip and Python scripts to hang when running

## Solution Implemented
- Created a new clean virtual environment (venv_new) with Python 3.12.9
- Installed all necessary dependencies excluding the problematic textract package
- Modified processing.py to make textract an optional dependency with graceful fallbacks
- Fixed indentation issues in the code that were causing syntax errors
- Created run_rag.sh script for easier execution with the new environment

## Usage Instructions
To run your application:
```
./run_rag.sh
```

To run other Python scripts:
```
/Users/gunnarhostetler/Documents/GitHub/PCPipeline/venv_new/bin/python your_script.py
```

To install additional packages:
```
/Users/gunnarhostetler/Documents/GitHub/PCPipeline/venv_new/bin/python -m pip install package_name
```

## Notes
- The warning about textract being unavailable is expected and won't impact core functionality
- Only file types that specifically require textract will be affected
- The GUI should now launch properly when you run ./run_rag.sh
